Born in May 18th, 1934 in Irapuato, Guanajuato. He joined the Bracero Program in September 1956 to help support his family. According to some family members, during his time in the Bracero Program he worked in Watsonville, CA picking strawberries.  After the Bracero Program, my grandpa [returned to Guanajuato and] started working as a custodian at an elementary school called “Margarita Masa de Juarez”. He would stay working there for the next 35 years. Carmen was loved very dearly in this school.  My grandfather had a total of 10 children and 21 grandchildren, including myself. From my whole family, only my mother came to the U.S looking for the American Dream, where we established in Salinas, CA. Coincidentally, we are only 30 mins away from the town my grandfather worked, small world.  He passed away in 2007, may he Rest in Paradise</span></div>

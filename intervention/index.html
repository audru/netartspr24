        <p>This is an intervention that occurs on TikTok.<br>
        This intervention is a TikTok account that only uses the <b>repost function</b> to share informational videos about the Bracero Program.<br>
        This approach differs from standard TikTok practices, as it strictly focuses on historical content and the sharing of others' content, rather than the creation of original videos.<br>
        The goal is to amplify the voices and messages of those who have already produced educational content on the Bracero Program and Mexican-American experiences.
        <br>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 137, 12);">This intervention first started in March 2024 and is  accesible as long as the account is live. </p>
            By using TikTok solely as a platform for reposting, this intervention disrupts the typical dynamics of content creation on the site. TikTok is largely driven by original content and individual creators, so an account dedicated solely to reposting challenges this norm. Focusing on a historical subject like the Bracero Program contrasts with the typical TikTok content, which is often light-hearted or trending topics.<br>

            <br>This intervention aims to draw users' attention to historical education and provoke thoughtful engagement with the past in a space usually dominated by entertainment.</p>
            <p style="color:rgb(255, 137, 12);"><b>Reflections from creator:</b> This intervention followed my initial proposal and provided an interesting way to engage users. I reflected on my interaction with TikTok, particularly the repost function. Through this account, I effectively compiled resources for users and promoted a plethora of accounts dedicated to knowledge and histories of Mexican American histories. If I had more time, I would have created a promotional video outlining the instructions and purpose of the account.</p>
